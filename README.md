# Simple Calculator CLI App 

This is a basic command-line calculator built using Python.  
It takes two numbers from the user and performs the selected operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

I used:
- Functions for each operation
- Input() for user interaction
- A loop to keep the calculator running until the user exits
